<h3>SDSC/UCSD Team Selected to Compete at SCC21:</h3>
The San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) and UC San Diego are pleased to announce that the SDSC/UCSD SCC21 Team has been selected to participate for the Virtual Student Cluster Competition (VSCC)! This years team includes 6 UCSD undergraduates: Grant	Castaneda, John (Qingsheng)	Ge, John	Li, Matthew	Mikhailov, and SCC20 memebers Arunav	Gupta and Zihao	Kong. Team mentors include Mary Thomas (SDSC, mpthomas@ucsd.edu) and Bryan Chin (UCSD CSE, b5chin@eng.ucsd.edu). Congratulations to the team for submitting a successful application.

<b>About the competition:</b> The annual Supercomputing conference SC21 in St. Louis, Missouri. SCC was developed in 2007 to immerse undergraduate and high school students in high performance computing. The SCC teams consist of 6 students who will design and build a small cluster with support from mentors and hardware and software vendor partners. They will learn designated scientific applications and apply optimization techniques for their chosen architectures. SCC teams compete against teams from around the world, in a non-stop 48-hour challenge to complete a real-world scientific workload, while keeping the cluster up and running, and demonstrating to the judges their HPC skills and knowledge. All team members are invited to attend the conference. Last years SCC20 team placed 4th/19 teams in the overall competition.
