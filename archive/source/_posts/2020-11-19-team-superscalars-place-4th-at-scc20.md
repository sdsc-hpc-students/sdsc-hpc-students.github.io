The Superscalars did very well considering that they were the first team sponsored
by UCSD/SDSC:  out of 19 teams, the 
Superscalars had the following significant accomplishments:
<ul>
<li>ranked 4th overall</li>
<li>achieved the highest score on the mystery application</li>
<li>ranked 3rd in HPCG with  4.056 TFlops</li>
<li>ranked 5th for the reproducibility application</li>
<li>ranked 6th for IO 500, with 16 GB/s</li>
<li>submitted full or partial results for all of the applications.</li>
</ul>
What a great job the team has done for the first SCC team hosted by SDSC 
and UCSD. For more information in the news, see <a href="https://www.sdsc.edu/News%20Items/PR20201130_student_cluster.html">SDSC News</a>.
