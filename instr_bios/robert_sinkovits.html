Robert Sinkovits, Ph.D. leads the scientific applications efforts at the San Diego Supercomputer Center. He has collaborated with researchers spanning many fields including physics, chemistry, astronomy, structural biology, finance, ecology, climate, immunology and the social sciences, always with an emphasis on making the most effective use of high end computing resources. Before returning to SDSC, he was the primary developer of the AUTO3DEM and IHRSR++ software packages used for solving the structures of icosahedral and helical macromolecular structures, respectively. Together with Richard Scheuermann (J. Craig Venter Institute), he co-leads the Human Vaccine Projects Data Management and Bioinformatics Hub.
