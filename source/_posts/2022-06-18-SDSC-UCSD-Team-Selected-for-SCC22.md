<h3>SDSC/UCSD Team Selected to Compete at SCC22:</h3>
The San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) and UC San Diego are pleased to announce that the SDSC/UCSD SCC22 Team has been selected to participate for the Virtual Student Cluster Competition (VSCC)! This years team includes 6 UCSD undergraduates: Edward Burns, Stefanie Dao, Longtian Bao, Yuchen Jing, Davit Margarian, and Matthew Mikhailov. Team mentors include Mary Thomas (SDSC, mpthomas@ucsd.edu) and Bryan Chin (UCSD CSE, b5chin@eng.ucsd.edu) and SDSC Staff Andreas Goetz, Mahidhar Tatineni, Bob Sinkovits and others. Congratulations to the team for submitting a successful application.

For details about this years competition, see the US Student Cluster Competition home page <a href="https://www.studentclustercompetition.us/">here</a> and the <a href="https://sc22.supercomputing.org/program/studentssc/student-cluster-competition/">SC21 SCC page</a>.

<b>About the competition:</b> The annual Supercomputing conference (SC22) will be held in Dallas, TX. SCC was developed in 2007 to immerse undergraduate and high school students in high performance computing. The SCC teams consist of 6 students who will design and build a small cluster with support from mentors and hardware and software vendor partners. They will learn designated scientific applications and apply optimization techniques for their chosen architectures. SCC teams compete against teams from around the world, in a non-stop 48-hour challenge to complete a real-world scientific workload, while keeping the cluster up and running, and demonstrating to the judges their HPC skills and knowledge. All team members are invited to attend the conference. Last years SCC21 team placed 4th/10 teams in the overall competition.
