<h3>SDSC/UCSD Team Wins HPL Benchmark at SCC22!</h3>
<p>
Team 2MuchCache won the HPL Benchmark competition by reaching 114.26 Teraflops under a 3000 Watt power limit and running on a SuperMicro system consisting of  4 AMD Insticnt GPUs and 128 cores of AMD EPYC 7773X CPUs.
The competition consists of the team running 4 HPC benchmarks and 4 science applications. The High-Performance Linpack benchmark implementation requires that each competitor run a well-known code to solve a uniformly random system of linear equations on their customized cluster and to then report time and floating-point execution rate using a standard formula for operation count.  The team won the HPL Benchmark competition by reaching 114.26 Teraflops under a 3000 Watt power limit, running on a SuperMicro system consisting of  4 AMD Insticnt GPUs and 128 cores of AMD EPYC 7773X CPUs.

Congratulations to the team for winning our first category ever. For more info on the team, see the [SCC22](https://hpc-students.sdsc.edu/scc/scc22/) website.

<b>About the competition:</b> The annual Supercomputing conference (SC22) will be held in Dallas, TX. SCC was developed in 2007 to immerse undergraduate and high school students in high performance computing. The SCC teams consist of 6 students who will design and build a small cluster with support from mentors and hardware and software vendor partners. They will learn designated scientific applications and apply optimization techniques for their chosen architectures. SCC teams compete against teams from around the world, in a non-stop 48-hour challenge to complete a real-world scientific workload, while keeping the cluster up and running, and demonstrating to the judges their HPC skills and knowledge. All team members are invited to attend the conference. Last years SCC21 team placed 4th/10 teams in the overall competition.
