<h3>SDSC/UCSD Team Competes at SCC24 in Atlanta, GA!</h3>
<p>The SDSC/UCSD SCC24 Team has been selected to participate in the annual 
  Student Cluster Competition at SC24 in Denver, CO. ! 
</p>
<p>
The SDSC/UCSD student cluster competition traveled to Atlanta, GA for the annual competition. They 
  were among a total of 12 in-person teams from around the world selected to compete. The team scored 
  4th overall, and best in the US/European teams, getting the highest score after the Asian teams 
  (with 12 H100s). Congratulations to the team for another excellent year.
</p>
<p>
The team did very well this year, considering the creative design of the cluster, which consisted of 
  three nodes, made by 3 different vendors. Each node had 2 AMD EPYC  Milans and 4 AMD INSTINCT MI200s. 
  This is the first heterogenous cluster ever brought to the competition. The team sends it’s 
  thanks to our mentors and sponsors for their support and for stopping by the booth!

<p>
This year’s team includes 6 UCSD undergraduates: Francisco Gutierrez (Team Lead), Zixian Wang (Co-Lead),
  Aarush Mehrotra, Gauri Renjith, Shijie Wang, and Zhiheng Feng. In addition, Ferrari Guan and 
  Flavia Tedjarutjianta travelled as team alternates. Team mentors include Mary Thomas (SDSC, mpthomas@ucsd.edu) 
  and Bryan Chin (UCSD CSE, b5chin@eng.ucsd.edu) and SDSC Staff Elham Khoda, Andreas Goetz, 
  Martin Kandes, Fernando Silva, Mahidhar Tatineni, Bob Sinkovits and others.

<b>About the competition:</b> The annual Supercomputing conference (SC24) will be held in Atlanta, GA. SCC was developed in 2007 to immerse undergraduate and high school students in high performance computing. The SCC teams consist of 6 students who will design and build a small cluster with support from mentors and hardware and software vendor partners. They will learn designated scientific applications and apply optimization techniques for their chosen architectures. SCC teams compete against teams from around the world, in a non-stop 48-hour challenge to complete a real-world scientific workload, while keeping the cluster up and running, and demonstrating to the judges their HPC skills and knowledge. All team members are invited to attend the conference.
