<h3>SDSC/UCSD Team Selected to Compete at SCC25!</h3>
<p>The San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) and UC San Diego are pleased to announce that for the 6th year in a row, the SDSC/UCSD SCC25 Team has been selected to participate in-person at the annual Student Cluster Competition at SC25 in St. Louis, MO.! 
This years team includes 6 UCSD undergraduates: Gauri Renjith, Ferrari Guan, Jinru Li, Luiz Gurrola, Ryan Estanislao, Shing Hung.
Team mentors include Mary Thomas (SDSC, mpthomas@ucsd.edu) and Bryan Chin (UCSD CSE, b5chin@eng.ucsd.edu) and SDSC Staff Andreas Goetz, Marty Kandes, Mahidhar Tatineni, Bob Sinkovits, AMD representatives Tom Papatheodore and Karl Schulz, and others. 
Congratulations to the team for submitting a successful application. For more info on the team, see the <a href="https://hpc-students.sdsc.edu/scc/scc24/">SCC25 Team </a> website.

<b>About the competition:</b> The annual Supercomputing conference (SC25) will be held in St. Louis, MO. SCC was developed in 2007 to immerse undergraduate and high school students in high performance computing. The SCC teams consist of 6 students who will design and build a small cluster with support from mentors and hardware and software vendor partners. They will learn designated scientific applications and apply optimization techniques for their chosen architectures. SCC teams compete against teams from around the world, in a non-stop 48-hour challenge to complete a real-world scientific workload, while keeping the cluster up and running, and demonstrating to the judges their HPC skills and knowledge. All team members are invited to attend the conference.
