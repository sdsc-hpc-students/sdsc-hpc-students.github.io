# About the Student Cluster Competition


SDSC supports many student activities, including the [Student Cluster Competition (SCC)](http://www.studentclustercompetition.us/) held at the annual [Supercomputing](https://supercomputing.org/) meeting.
The SCC was developed in 2007 to immerse undergraduate and high school students in high performance computing. The SCC teams consist of a mentor plus 6 students who will design and build a small cluster with support from mentors and hardware and software vendor partners. They will learn designated scientific applications and apply optimization techniques for their chosen architectures. SCC teams compete against teams from around the world, in a non-stop 48-hour challenge to complete a real-world scientific workload, while keeping the cluster up and running, and demonstrating to the judges their HPC skills and knowledge.  Acceptance to the SC competition is competitive and requires intense preparation and skill development. This year, SCC will be held at the annual Supercomputing conference [SC23](https://sc23.supercomputing.org/students/student-cluster-competition/) in Denver, CO, November 12 – 17, 2023.

Since 2019, the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) and UC San Diego (UCSD) have sent teams to SCC, and we hope to continue the tradition. The SC Club has many activities that help train and prepare our teams. Our SCC20, SCC21, and SCC22 teams finished 4th overall, in 2022 the team won the HPL Benchmark, and in 2023, the team placed 3rd overall, and co-won the MLPerf benchmark. The team members had a great experience each time, even though the competitions were virtual. See below links for team bio’s and event details. This year, we are planning to submit an application to SCC24.
