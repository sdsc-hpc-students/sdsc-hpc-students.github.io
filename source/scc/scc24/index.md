The San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) and UC San Diego are putting together a team to compete in the Student Cluster Competition (SCC), held at the annual Supercomputing conference SC21 in St. Louis, Missouri. SCC was developed in 2007 to immerse undergraduate and high school students in high performance computing. The SCC teams consist of 6 students who will design and build a small cluster with support from mentors and hardware and software vendor partners. They will learn designated scientific applications and apply optimization techniques for their chosen architectures. SCC teams compete against teams from around the world, in a non-stop 48-hour challenge to complete a real-world scientific workload, while keeping the cluster up and running, and demonstrating to the judges their HPC skills and knowledge. All team members are invited to attend the conference. In 2020 and 2021, SDSC and UC San Diego hosted competition teams who finished 4th overall. This team had a great experience! See below links for team bio’s and event details.

A team of 6 UC San Diego students will be selected to form the core team, as well as a group of alternates. This team will work together through the summer and fall to build out an HPC cluster at SDSC on the campus of UC San Diego. They will learn to run the SCC24 challenge applications, some of which are listed on the SCC page. This year both the team members and alternates will be enrolled in a 199 course for credit, and will be eligible for CCR credits for associated activities. Team members must be undergraduates in December 2021.

The SCC competition is competitive and requires intense preparation and skill development. We expect each member of the team to commit 10-20 hours a week through summer and fall. The competition will run November 16 – 18, for a continual 48 hours. All team members are required to fully participate during the competition. If you are selected we will assist you to work with professors to help arrange any missed classes. The conference is to be held in St. Louis, Missouri, however, it is still to be determined if this event will be held in-person, remote or hybrid. The application will ask your preference. As part of the application we will ask you for a brief 2-4 sentence bio. If selected this will be used on the competition website. See the SC20 SCC Team site for an example.
