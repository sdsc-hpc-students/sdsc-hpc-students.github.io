    <b>HPC Training: </b> This is an annual, 10 week course. Participants will learn common HPC concepts including 
    optimization, distributed computing, cloud computing, GPU acceleration, and parallel computing. 
    Training is presented by SDSC staff and collaborators Those students who complete the HPC training will 
    receive an SDSC Certificate of Completion in “HPC Training." (Fall Quarter)
  </li>
  <li><b>[Raspberry PI Cluster buildout project:](https://hpc-students.sdsc.edu/pi-proj.html)</b> Students will work together to build a 
    16 or 32 node PI cluster. (Spring Quarter)
  </li>
  <li><b>SDSC Students@Supercomputing:</b> One of the largest technical meetings in HPC in the world is 
    the annual Supercomputing Conference 
    (<a href="https://supercomputing.org">https://supercomputing.org</a>). SC is where experts in 
    High-Performance Computing (HPC) meet. HPC spans many scientific computing domains including 
    Math, Physics, Biology, and Data and Environmental Sciences. <br>
    Applications are open (February 10, 2020 – June 5, 2020) for Student Volunteers, 
    the Student Cluster Competition, and the new #HPCImmersion Program. Get your application started today 
    to join us at #SC20 in Atlanta, GA for the SC Conference! https://sc20.supercomputing.org/program/studentssc/

    <b> SC Student Cluster Competition Team</b></li>
    SDSC supports many student activities, including the  
    (<a href="http://www.studentclustercompetition.us/">http://www.studentclustercompetition.us/</a>). 
    SCC was developed in 2007 to immerse undergraduate and high school students in high performance computing. 
    Student teams must learn to design and build small cluster with support from mentors, hardware and 
    software vendor partners, learn designated scientific applications, apply optimization techniques 
    for their chosen architectures. At the SC conference, teams of 6 students compete against teams 
    from all over the world, in a non-stop, 48-hour challenge to complete a real-world scientific workload, 
    keep the cluster up and running, attend conference events, and demonstrate to the judges their HPC knowledge 
    and skills. Acceptance to the SC competition is competitive and requires intense preparation and skill development.
