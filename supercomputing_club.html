<h3> Who are we?</h3>

We are the UCSD Supercomputing Club. We exist to provide an open and inclusive environment for UCSD students to learn and develop the skills of the High Performance Computing industry. Our goal is to make the knowledge and technology surrounding this industry accessible to students of all majors and backgrounds.
The Supercomputing club collaborates with and is sponsored by the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) through the High Performance Computing Students Program. To learn more about the HPC-Students initiative, please see: [HPC Students Program](https://www.sdsc.edu/education_and_training/hpc_students.html).

<h3> Why HPC?</h3>

The field of High Performance Computing spans many domains outside in Scientific Computing including
Applied Math, Physics, Biology, and Data and Environmental Sciences.
We are continuing to develop content to educate our club members in concepts common in HPC, including
optimization, distributed computing, cloud computing, containers, GPU acceleration, and parallel code at scale.
In order to do this, we have curated a series of in-person workshops as well as 'crash course' style videos on
[our YouTube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgKelmfwqf5NffobCGXAcLg?)

We also aim to work with the [SDSC HPC Students Program](https://www.sdsc.edu/education_and_training/hpc_students.html)
on its many [Programs and Projects](https://hpc-students.sdsc.edu/scc.html), including building out a Raspberry PI cluster,
attending Supercomputing, and other activities.

For more information on the SDSCs' SCC team training plans, see the [SCC Information Page](https://training.sdsc.edu/scc")

<h3> Who do we seek?  </h3>

It is our firm belief that the most important qualities of members (and students in general!) are curiosity and motivation.
Most of the necessary skills can be taught with a relatively gentle learning curve, regardless of your major.

If any of these are true of you, you're in the right place!
- You want to participate in building and optimizing a supercomputer
- You'd like to execute code on the fastest computers in the world
- You enjoy working with the Linux Command Line
- Belonging to an inclusive technology focused community on campus appeals to you

We'd love your help getting this club the platform and reach it - and you as students - deserve.
It won't be the same without you.
